## ‚ú® Key Features
-**Modular Multi-Model ML Core:** Seamlessly switch between multiple fraud detection algorithms (Isolation Forest, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) via the UI for comparative analysis.
-**Secure User Authentication:** Robust signup and login system using JWT tokens with a configurable 30-minute session timeout to secure all sensitive endpoints.
-**Encrypted Data Storage:** Sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, is encrypted using the cryptography library before being stored in the SQLite database, ensuring data privacy.
-**High-Performance Batch Ingestion:** Efficiently ingest and append large transaction datasets from CSV files into the database.
-**Asynchronous Fraud Detection:** Run ML detection models as background tasks using FastAPI's built-in support, preventing UI freezes and allowing for a smooth user experience.
-**Real-time Progress Monitoring:** A dedicated API endpoint provides live progress updates on the status of the detection process, reflected dynamically on the frontend.
-**Comprehensive Reporting:** View detailed fraud reports directly in the UI and download a complete CSV file for offline analysis.
-**Complete Audit Trail:** Log every significant user action (ingestion, detection runs, model retraining, data clearing) for accountability and tracking.
-**On-Demand Model Retraining:** Trigger the ML model retraining process at any time via an API endpoint to keep the models updated with the latest data patterns.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models & Workflow
This system employs a sophisticated, cyclical workflow that leverages both unsupervised and supervised learning to achieve high accuracy.
Available Models
-**Isolation Forest (Unsupervised):** Ideal for initial analysis on unlabeled data. It excels at identifying anomalies and outliers that are likely fraudulent.
-**Random Forest (Supervised):** The most powerful and accurate model in the suite. It is a robust ensemble method that provides a great balance of performance and feature insight. Training is parallelized using n_jobs=-1 for maximum speed.
-**Logistic Regression & Decision Tree (Supervised):** Excellent for establishing a performance baseline and for their high interpretability, allowing for easy-to-understand decision rules.
-**Recommended Workflow**
The application is designed for a powerful, three-stage process:
Labeling with Isolation Forest:
-**1.Ingest Data:** Upload a new transaction CSV file.
-**2.Select Model:** Choose Isolation Forest from the dropdown.
-**3.Run Detection:** This initial run will process the unlabeled data and generate the first set of labels (fraud / not-fraud).
-**4.Training Supervised Models:**
 --  **a.Select Model:** Choose a supervised model like Random Forest.
 --  **b.Train Model:** Click the "Retrain Selected Model" button. The model will now train on the rich, labeled dataset created in the previous step, learning complex fraud patterns. This creates a saved .pkl file for the model.
**High-Accuracy Detection then Select Model:** Keep Random Forest selected.
-**5.Run Detection:** Run the fraud detection again. The system will now use the highly accurate, trained supervised model to find fraudulent transactions with greater precision.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Notes
**Important: Ignoring Large Files**
The .gitignore file is configured to ignore sensitive and large files like transactions.db, raw datasets (.csv), and the Python virtual environment (.venv). Do NOT commit these files to your repository.

**CORS Issues**
The app/main.py file is pre-configured with a permissive CORS policy for local development. If you deploy this application, you should restrict the allow_origins to your frontend's specific domain.

Python
```
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["[http://127.0.0.1:5500](http://127.0.0.1:5500)"], # Change to your domain in production
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

***Cleaning Git History*** (If large files were committed accidentally)
If you accidentally commit a large file, you can remove it from your repository's history using git-filter-repo.

Bash
```

pip install git-filter-repo
Then, run the command to remove a specific file or folder
git filter-repo --path transactions.db --invert-paths --force
git filter-repo --path transactions/ --invert-paths --force
git push origin main --force

```
