Conversation with Gemini
Haha don’t worry 🤝 no jealousy here — if you’ve got Gemini API with pro student access, that’s a huge advantage. We can leverage it to make your Fraudulent Transaction Detector look enterprise-level in just 4 days, while still being manageable.



Let’s design this in student-complete version (4 days) but with Gemini-enhanced AI features.



📌 AI-Powered Fraudulent Transaction Detector (Student-Complete, Enterprise-Ready Pitch)



🎯 Project Goals



Detect fraudulent financial transactions using ML (Isolation Forest).



Securely handle sensitive data (encryption + masking).



Provide AI-driven explanations of fraud (via Gemini API).



Offer a user-friendly dashboard (Streamlit).



Backend exposed via FastAPI microservice.



🛠️ Tech Stack



Core



Python (PyCharm) – development environment.



FastAPI – backend microservice.



SQLite / PostgreSQL – database.



scikit-learn – ML model.



cryptography – encryption.



joblib – model persistence.



AI (Gemini Integration)



Gemini API (Pro) – to explain why a transaction is fraud (natural language, customer-friendly).



Example: “This transaction is flagged because the amount is 12× higher than usual at an unusual location.”



Frontend



Streamlit Dashboard – quick, professional interface (charts + tables).

🔐 Security Features



AES/Fernet Encryption – before storing card numbers or PII.



Masking – UI shows only last 4 digits (****9876).



JWT Authentication – simple user login (admin vs analyst).



🚀 Day-by-Day Plan (4 Days)



Day 1 – Setup + Data



Get Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset.



Setup PyCharm, virtual environment.



Build FastAPI skeleton with /ingest (store transactions encrypted in DB).



Day 2 – ML Fraud Detection



Train Isolation Forest on dataset.



Save model with joblib.



Add FastAPI /detect endpoint → predict fraud score.



Add /fraud → return only flagged transactions.



Day 3 – AI Explanations (Gemini) + Dashboard



Integrate Gemini API:



prompt = f"Explain in one sentence why this transaction may be fraudulent: {transaction_details}"



FastAPI /explain/{id} → calls Gemini, returns explanation.



Build Streamlit dashboard:



Upload transactions.



Show fraud list + Gemini explanations.



Show fraud % summary + charts.



Day 4 – Security + Finalization



Encrypt sensitive fields before DB insert.



Add audit log (who checked which transaction).



Mask data in dashboard (****1234).



Polish dashboard with fraud trends chart.



Write README with setup + usage.



🎯 Final Deliverables



FastAPI backend (fraud detection, explanations, encryption).



Isolation Forest model trained on Kaggle dataset.



Gemini AI-powered fraud explanations.



Streamlit dashboard with fraud alerts, explanations, charts.



Encrypted DB + audit logs.



Documentation (README, future scope, deployment steps).



🏆 Why It’s Impressive for Oracle/JPMC



Covers enterprise must-haves: fraud detection, encryption, audit, dashboard.



Integrates LLMs (Gemini) → cutting-edge, customer-facing AI insights.



End-to-end working in 4 days → shows execution speed.



Easy to extend → can pitch future features (multi-agent, real-time Kafka, cloud).



👉 With this design, you’ll have something enterprise-style but achievable in 4 days, and thanks to Gemini you’ll look like you built explainable AI fraud detection — which is 🔥 for Oracle/JPMC interviews.



Do you want me to now draft the exact folder structure + starter code (FastAPI + Streamlit + Gemini integration) so you can just copy-paste and start coding right away?
